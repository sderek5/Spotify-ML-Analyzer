# Spotify-ML-Analyzer
This project uses machine learning to analyze personal Spotify listening data. It extracts audio features and metadata from top tracks, then builds predictive models to uncover patterns in listening behavior and song characteristics. The project demonstrates end-to-end ML workflow skills, including data collection via the Spotify API, preprocessing, feature analysis, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

Key Features:
Fetches user-specific Spotify data with audio features using the Spotipy library
Preprocesses and cleans the dataset for ML modeling
Implements supervised learning models (e.g., Gradient Boosting, Random Forest) to predict song characteristics or user preferences
Provides feature importance analysis to identify which song attributes most influence predictions
Fully reproducible pipeline, suitable as a resume-ready ML project
