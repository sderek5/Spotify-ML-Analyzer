Personal Music Analytics – Project 1

Personal Music Analytics – Project 1 is a deep dive into a personal Spotify playlist to understand what drives your favorite songs. By pulling track metadata and audio features directly from Spotify, the project cleans and organizes the data, then visualizes it in interactive charts that reveal patterns in tempo, energy, danceability, and more. The goal is to uncover a personalized “taste profile” and explore how different songs relate to each other.

This project transforms raw data into insights. You can see which artists dominate your playlist, how your music preferences evolve, and which audio features tend to co-occur. It’s a visual and analytical exploration of personal listening habits.

Built with Python, Plotly, and Spotipy, the project demonstrates an end-to-end data workflow: from collection, cleaning, and preprocessing, to visualization and analysis. It’s a portfolio-ready example of taking real-world data and turning it into meaningful, interpretable results.

If you want, I can also tweak it further to make it portfolio-ready for college applications, emphasizing skills without making it sound like it’s just about playlists. Do you want me to do that?
